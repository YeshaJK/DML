# DML
This project focuses on predicting PM2.5 concentrations from environmental data to improve air quality monitoring. The dataset used for this model was sourced from the Auckland Council Environmental Data Portal, covering data from January 2019 to December 2023. The dataset includes variables such as NO, NO2, NOx, SO2, wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, relative humidity, and the air quality index.

Data Preprocessing: The raw data was cleaned using Python's Pandas library, eliminating irrelevant rows and ensuring proper feature naming.
Model Development: I used Multi-Layer Perceptron Regression (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms to build predictive models for PM2.5 concentrations.
Feature Selection: Key environmental variables were selected to train the model and improve prediction accuracy.
